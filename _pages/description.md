#### What is Weavez?

Weavez gives birth to relationships between students. This project started from the University of Padova. It is an instrument to develop friendship relationships, feeding university experiences.

#### Is it just a chat app?

Weavez is a social networks that works through secure chats. Other than the chat, Weavez allows their users to organize activities and find new friends to share activities of any type with them.

#### Is it secure?

To use Weavez, every user should sign up with their university email. This way, there won't be any fake users. Other instruments and features were thought so that Weaevz is secure and reliable to use.

#### When will it be available?

We are doing some tests and we are confident that our project will be operative in 2021.
